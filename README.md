Mostly in Javascript

## Day 12 

### Part one 

the idea was to implement a Breadth-First search algorithm. I created an object Node which has an attribute 'adjacents' containing all nodes it is possible to move from the current node. I didn't use a queue data structure in the search function because the amount of adjacent nodes was 4 maximum. To enhance the search function I could have use a bidirectional search.
